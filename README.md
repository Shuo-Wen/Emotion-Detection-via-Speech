# Emotion-Detection-via-Speech
Master-level Artificial Neural Network: Theory and Application course project Fall, 2017, National Taiwan University
Recognizing emotion from speech has become one the active research themes in speech processing and in applications based on human-computer interaction. 
In this project, we conducts an experimental study on recognizing emotions from human speech. 
The emotions which are considered for our experiments include neutral, anger, joy and sadness with the accuracy of 78.25%.
